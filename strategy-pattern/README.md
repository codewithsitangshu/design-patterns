# Strategy Design Pattern

<img src="strategy-design-pattern-logo.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful tool in software design, allowing us to define a range of algorithms for a particular task and encapsulate each one separately. By doing so, we make these algorithms interchangeable, providing flexibility to our applications. This pattern becomes invaluable when faced with scenarios where multiple algorithms can be utilized, but the specific choice may vary at runtime. With the Strategy Pattern, the algorithms can evolve independently from the code that employs them, enhancing maintainability and extensibility. Ultimately, it empowers developers to adapt and optimize their software's behavior without restructuring the entire system.
